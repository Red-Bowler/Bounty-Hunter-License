The Bonty Hunter License tries to address the followng issues:

- Boring to read licenses.
- Costly trials.
- Hard to prove software usage.
- Increasing use of licensed software to train AI.

There may be people saying "I don't care that people use my software for free or train AI with it.", and that's good because diversity of opinion makes human intellect grow providing new ideas and innovation. In the same way people who care should be respected, but I feel is harder to find people willing to help the later, so I tried to encourage people to do something using a reward system.

Feel free to suggest improvments or use in your projects.
